             <h1> Miya: A Sweet Soul with Mysterious Mind</h2>
             <p>
                Miya is a creative spirit thriving in the heart of <strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>, a city rich in diversity and inspiration. 
                She loves exploring new places, especially her beloved <strong>"Nations Market,"</strong> where cultures blend in a vibrant mix of flavors and stories. 
                With an eye for all things charming, she adores <strong>pretty packaging, miniatures, and dreamy home décor—especially in pink!</strong>
            </p>
        
            <p>
                A natural visionary, Miya finds joy in bringing her ideas to life, whether through <strong>DIY projects, baking, or design.</strong> 
                She balances her soft, whimsical aesthetic with a fascination for the eerie and mysterious, drawn to 
                <strong>psychological thrillers, horror films, and true crime podcasts</strong> while still appreciating the warmth of 
                <strong>romantic comedies and Disney classics.</strong>
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Beyond her passions, Miya is deeply intentional about how she lives, finding beauty in both the little moments and the bigger picture. 
                Though introverted, she has a <strong>bubbly and uplifting presence</strong>, making conversations feel effortless and refreshing. 
                She listens intently, encourages others, and fills every space she enters with <strong>joy, creativity, and a touch of magic.</strong> 
                If she could have any superpower, she’d love to be <strong>psychic</strong>—not just to see what’s ahead, but to sharpen her intuition 
                (and maybe even win the lottery!).
